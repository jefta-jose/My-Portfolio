      <h4>
        I'm <span>Jeff Ndegwa,</span> Full Stack Developer / Designer
      </h4>
      <p>
        üëã Hi there, I'm Jeff Ndegwa, a dedicated developer on an exciting
        journey to becoming an efficient full-stack powerhouse. Currently
        immersed in learning the intricacies of React, JavaScript, and Node, I'm
        passionate about mastering the tools that drive innovation in the tech
        world. üí° Every line of code is a step forward in my quest for
        proficiency. I find joy in unraveling the mysteries of React, the
        dynamism of JavaScript, and the server-side magic of Node.js. As I
        navigate through this learning adventure, I'm motivated by the desire to
        contribute meaningful solutions to real-world problems. üöÄ Join me on
        this coding odyssey as I hone my skills and work towards becoming a
        versatile full-stack developer. Whether it's crafting engaging user
        interfaces or optimizing server performance, every challenge is an
        opportunity to grow and learn. Let's code, learn, and build together.
        The journey to full-stack efficiency is an ongoing process, and I'm
        thrilled to be on this path! üåêüíª
